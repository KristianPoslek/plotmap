# What is Plotmap?
Plotmap is a web application which allows you to explore places from books on a map.

## What are the (future) features of Plotmap?
Plotmap supports (or plans to support) the following features:

- Books
  - Adding books by using an external API
  - Adding locations by using an external Map provider
  - Exploring added books and plot locations
- Users
  - Creating and managing accounts
  - Different user roles

# Is the application deployed in production anywhere?
This repository is a playground for building a full-stack application and exploring different ideas, programming languages, frameworks, libraries etc.

It probably doesn't make sense to have a real deployment because the myriad of different book-related web sites out there (like Goodreads) would be able to implement it much better.

The ideas, concepts and code, on the other hand, is the real treasure and is probably worth exploring. ðŸ˜„
